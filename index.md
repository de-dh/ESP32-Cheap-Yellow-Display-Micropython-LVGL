# Cheap-Yellow-Display Micropython LVGL Guide and Examples

## Introduction
CYDs


## Display And Touch Screen Driver Setup
Although CYDs from different vendors look almost identical, they may require varying display and touch screen initialization setups.
The main differences are
- MADCTL configuration (display roration and mirroring)
- Color modes: RGB vs. BGR
- Touch screen calibration: mirroring the x/y-axis or swapping the axes may be neccessary.

The correct configuration for a specific display can only be found by trial and error.
